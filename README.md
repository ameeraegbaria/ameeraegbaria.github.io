Hi, my name is Ameera Egbaria. I am a dedicated Ph.D. student at the [Weizmann Institute of Science](https://www.weizmann.ac.il/pages/), specializing in Immunology and Regenerative Biology under the guidance of [Prof. Igor Ulitsky](https://www.weizmann.ac.il/dept/irb/igor-ulitsky/).

My current research investigates the molecular mechanisms of RNA export factors, bridging knowledge from the nucleus to the cytoplasm to enhance understanding in this complex field.

I hold a Master’s degree from the Weizmann Institute, where my project focused on viral proteins' effects on nuclear RNA export, and a Bachelor’s degree in Life Sciences from The Open University, graduating with distinction.

Alongside my studies, I tutor at the Davidson Institute of Science Education, bringing scientific concepts to diverse learners.

I have also gained hands-on experience through internships in various Weizmann Institute programs, working on projects with therapeutic potential in cancer research. 
Proficient in molecular biology techniques, R programming, and skilled in multiple languages
